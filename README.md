# Cpp-Programming

##Summary of project
This project was created to help the user decide on a savings plan. It breaks down how much money will be accrued with monthly deposits as well as without monthly deposits to help the user decide what will be best for them and how much money they will have in years to come.

##Done particularly well
I believe what I did particularly well was the mathematics for this project. It took some time to make sure everything was calculated properly. The report with monthly deposits took much longer to get right and I was really happy to see it finally work.

##Enhancing the code
I believe that making this code more secure my using CERT standards would be much better for a code such as this that deals with a banking app. Having enhanced security is essential when dealing with this type of information. 

##Challenges in this code
There were definitely some challanges to this code but I would say the greatest challenge was making sure the math was correct. I had to use paper and pencil to think it all out and get it written out so that I could make sure I am getting the information correct. It took a bit longer than expected to get it right but it is a good feeling to see a piece of code working.

##Transferable skills
Skills that can be passed on to different projects down the road include the use of OOP and using header files. Using a seperate source file to do all the functions in makes the main source code so much more readable and easier to understand. I like when there is order and the code feels clean.

##Maintainable, readable, adaptable
The code is seperated into 2 source files and a header file. One of the source file is the main function and the other contains all the functions declared in the header file. Keeping the main function simple makes it easily readable and all the functions in the other source file helps the code to be maintainable so that if any changes need to be made then just changing it inside the function will fix it across the board. The code is also adaptable because the functions can be used throughout other code if needed.
